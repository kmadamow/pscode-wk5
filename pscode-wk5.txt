// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Input the number
If the number is divisible by 2
	It is even
Else
	It is odd


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Enter a number
Add that number to sum
If the number is smaller than min, remember it as min
If the number is bigger than max, remember it as max
Repeat those steps 5 times
Calculate the average by dividing the sum by 5
Print "The average number is:" average
Print "The smallest number is:" min
Print "The largest number is:" max
